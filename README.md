Sample XAML C++ WinRT app based on the Microsoft Docs, there are two tutorials for this walkthrough

1. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/binding-property
2. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/binding-collection

Since the Cpp/WinRT stuff is in early stage development things may change.
